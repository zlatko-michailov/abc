`abc` is a C++ header-only library that complements the `std` library. The most notable `abc` entities are:
- HTTP endpoint
- socket (TCP and UDP)
- HTTP streams
- JSON streams
- virtual memory

Those entities enable a C++ daemon running on remote device to have a GUI as well as a REST API surface.

Additionally, `abc` provides:
- generic table output stream
- diagnostic log
- test framework
- timestamp

All classes are provided as headers.
The needed ones must be included and compiled in client programs.
There is no precompiled flavor of the library that needs to be linked.
